# CoreAutoCrudApp
This application is a general playground for experimenting with .NET Core, ASP.NET Web API and ReactJS.   Implemented here is a CSV importer which loads the contents to a SQLite database using Entity Framework.  There are two flavours of Front End, a traditional MVC version and a React front end.  The React front end talks to the ASP.NET Web API, which then talks to Entity Framework. The MVC version talks directly to Entity Framework (but also has the CUD parts of CRUD implemented)  Both versions are asynchronous and the React version uses promises.
